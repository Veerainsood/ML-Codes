1) Custom loss function and Autograd library usage (topics: 1-7 pytorch based)
2) CNN
3) Auto Encoders
4) VAE, GAN
5) RNN variants - Simple, Pre-built types: GRU and LSTM type cells
6) Transformer - simple concept understanding level codes
7) Next token prediction - simple concept understanding level codes
8) Sklearn topics as we discussed in the lab
9) Seaborn library plotting as we discussed in lab
